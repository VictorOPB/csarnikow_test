Task1: Moving average function applied to a simple time series, with plot.

The defining trends and patterns of noisy time series data can be better visualized when applying a moving average function over the data. Seasonal time series, whose patterns repeat at regular intervals, have their seasonal component detected by smoothing out the noise of the data, which can be done through moving average functions. Lastly, outlier detection and data volume compression are also optimal effects generated by applying moving average function to a noisy time series.

Task2: Buying maguffins with constraints

Buying maguffins with different pricing scenarios can be seen as a simplified and abstract representation of financial analysis and optimization - cost management with a limited budget, optimization to buy the maximum number of maguffins with different growth patterns (linear and exponential).

Task3: Data extraction and smoothing

The data extraction part of this task was made by reading the provided file correctly and duely extracting the required information, transforming it in a more readable data type to further analysis.
